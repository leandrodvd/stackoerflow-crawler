# stackoverflow-to-watson-nlc

This project contains a NodeJS app that uses StackExchange API to extract Title and Tags from StackOverflow questions to generate a .csv file that can be used as training data for IBM Watson Natural Language Classifier

#Be careful
Dont run this too much times in a small period as it can be considered an abuse of stack exchange API and new requests from your IP address will be blocked for some time (and if it happens to you, cool down and go walk and relax for a while, probably it is a good time for a break)
